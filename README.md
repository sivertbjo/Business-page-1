# Business-page-1
The first proper website I ever made - mobile friendly and accessible. Made with Bootstrap 5 and a very simple PHP mail form.

I used a javascript audio-player called green-audio-player.js, which isn't supported anymore - the code seems to have stopped working somehow. 
On my new website I made the switch to Plyr.
