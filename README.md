# Business-page-1
The first proper website I ever made - mobile friendly and accessible. Made with Bootstrap 5 and a very simple PHP mail form.

I used a javascript audio-player called green-audio-player.js, which isn't supported anymore - the code seems to have stopped working somehow. 
On my new website I made the switch to Plyr.

The folder management is crap, I've paid more attention to this on newer projects!

Feel free to use this as a template of some sorts. Perhaps update to the newest Bootstrap and connect it to a CMS?
